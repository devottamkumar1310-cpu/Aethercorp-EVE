"""
Refuses to run the test suite against a non-local database.

WHY THIS EXISTS — a real incident, 2026-08-01:

`app.database.engine` is built from DATABASE_URL, and DATABASE_URL points at
production Supabase even when the suite runs on a laptop. Any test that binds to
that engine operates on live customer data. One did:

    # tests/test_demo_workspace_consistency.py
    finally:
        Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)     # <-- dropped 34 production tables

Running `pytest tests/` dropped every application table in production. Only
`alembic_version` survived, because it is not part of Base.metadata. The schema
was silently recreated — empty — on the next backend cold start, because
init_db() calls create_all() at startup. Nothing alerted: no error, no failed
request. 49 accounts remained in Supabase's own auth.users while every profile,
workspace and uploaded catalogue behind them was gone.

The guard is deliberately a hard abort at collection time rather than a fixture,
so it fires before any test module's import-time or fixture code can touch the
engine.

To run integration tests, point DATABASE_URL at a local or disposable database:

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/eve_test pytest

To override deliberately (you had better be certain):

    EVE_ALLOW_NONLOCAL_TEST_DB=1 pytest
